# BudgetBuyers

## Problem Statment

Since the covid online market has taken a boom. That boom has created a never-ending need of buying products from online. 

Due to this scenario there are many site online like Amazon , Flipkart ,  Croma etc which are offering products at best price. Hence this leads to a lot of competion which results into a price of a product changing every day.

However said that this all leads to a lot of confusion and people really waste a lot of time for searching the best price for the laptop or phone that they are willing to buy.

So, to solve this problem once and for all we came up with Budget Buyers.!

## Solution and Approach

To solve this problem, we are planning to create a NextGen website that will contain multiple products along with the prices on different site.

For example, if you wonâ€™t to buy a MacBook 14 then you can simply go through budget buyers and see all the prices from Amazon, Flipkart, Croma store or even from Apple site as well.

So, there is no more searching for the best price for a product. Right now, we have included only laptops, but we can start adding multiple varieties of products!
